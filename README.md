# SEC - Security companion to the excellent Palantar library

_SEC_ offers an companion to the use of the  Palantar `Configuration Values`[^1] is an open source library which provides an easy way to secure configuration for Java server side applications written in DropWizard.

The Palantar's library is excellent to use, but lacks an eloquent command line tool to work with encrypted configurations. SEC attempts to fill this gap by providing, in addition to core encrypting encrypting of single value, the following additional capabilities:

- Ability to also decrypt not also a single value, but also a complete document.
- Ability to encrypt a values within a configuration document based on ant style property path selections.
- Optionally convert an encrypted/decrypted configuration document to JSON, and Java Properties.
-  Generate secure random binary values with, or without seed values.

As most command line utilities are cryptic at best (even with documentation), _SEC_ also attempts to provide a better user experience by supplying descriptive/detail error messages.
